# Furious 5s Videobooth Bot

This repo allows users to upload a video through a Telegram bot, which the first 4 seconds gets cropped for payload optimization, then applies a frame overlay to the video in different styles (portrait and landscape). The bot provides two processed video options that users can download.


### Sample Processed Video
To give you an idea of how the bot processes videos, here's a sample processed video with the overlay applied.

## Prerequisites

To run this bot locally, you need:

- Python 3.12 installed.
- A Telegram Bot Token (you can get it from [@BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather)).
- `ffmpeg` installed on your local system for video processing.

Optionally, you could also host this bot on a cloud service such as AWS (instructions included for how to set up an EC2 instance)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:anngineering/furious.git
   cd furious
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

   Itâ€™s recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**

   - For **Windows**:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - For **Mac/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install the dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Setup Environment Variables

1. **Create a `.env` file:**

   Copy the `.env.template` file and rename it to `.env`.

   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env
   ```

2. **Edit the `.env` file:**

   Add your **Telegram Bot Token** (`TELE_API_TOKEN`) and other required variables, such as directories for temporary files (`CACHE_DIR`) and overlays (`PORTRAIT_OVERLAY_FRAME_1_DIR`, etc.).

   Example:

   ```env
   TELE_API_TOKEN=your-telegram-bot-token
   CACHE_DIR=./temp
   PORTRAIT_OVERLAY_FRAME_1_DIR=./overlays/portrait_frame1.png
   PORTRAIT_OVERLAY_FRAME_2_DIR=./overlays/portrait_frame2.png
   LANDSCAPE_OVERLAY_FRAME_1_DIR=./overlays/landscape_frame1.png
   LANDSCAPE_OVERLAY_FRAME_2_DIR=./overlays/landscape_frame2.png
   ```

   Make sure to set up the correct paths for your overlay frames and cache directory.

## Running the Bot Locally

1. **Ensure that `ffmpeg` is installed:**

   For **Mac/Linux**:
   ```bash
   brew install ffmpeg
   ```

   For **Windows**, download the executable from [FFmpeg's official site](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add it to your system's PATH.

2. **Start the bot:**

   To start the bot on your local machine, run the following command:

   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

   The bot will start polling for messages. You should now be able to access the bot via the link `t.me/your_bot_username` created when initializing the bot with [@BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather). You can send a video to the bot, and it will process the video and send you two options with different frame overlays.

## Hosting the Bot on AWS EC2

To host the bot on an AWS EC2 instance, follow the instructions in the official AWS documentation here: [Getting Started with EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html).

### Steps:
1. **Launch an EC2 instance**:
   - Follow the guide on the AWS documentation to launch an EC2 instance (Ubuntu, Amazon Linux, or any preferred Linux distribution).
   - Ensure your EC2 instance has an appropriate security group allowing SSH (port 22) and any other necessary ports.

2. **Set up your EC2 instance**:
   - SSH into your EC2 instance from your local machine:
     ```bash
     ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ubuntu@your-ec2-public-ip
     ```

3. **Install dependencies on the EC2 instance**:
   - Install Python 3.12, `ffmpeg`, and other necessary packages on the EC2 instance:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install python3.12 python3-pip ffmpeg git
     ```

4. **Transfer your code to EC2**:
   - You can use SCP to copy your codebase from your local machine to the EC2 instance:
     ```bash
     scp -i /path/to/your-key.pem -r /path/to/your/code ubuntu@your-ec2-public-ip:/home/ubuntu/furious
     ```

5. **Setup environment and run the bot**:
   - SSH into your EC2 instance and navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd /home/ubuntu/furious
     ```
   - Create a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python3.12 -m venv venv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - Install the dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Edit the `.env` file on your EC2 instance and set your environment variables.
   - Run the bot:
     ```bash
     python src/main.py
     ```

Now, your bot should be up and running on AWS EC2!
